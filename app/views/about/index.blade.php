				<p>BestBant is a citizen opinion website that allows both sides of any topical issue to be expressed and heard on a weekly basis. BestBant believes that in a connected world the need 'to be heard' and 'hear others' is a powerful thing. BestBant believes that once a week the attention of the nation becomes the focus because of the convergence of media coverage and public opinion making. This could be a shameful scandal, a terrible disaster, a marvelous development, an unexpected surprise, a huge disappointment, or a political faux pas or triumph. In the age of social media, BestBant believes we have tired of experts telling us what to think and how to feel. BestBant hopes to give voice to yet unknown Dylans, Churchills, and Lincolns whose voices have the power to change heart and minds.</p>
