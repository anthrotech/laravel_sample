				<p>BestBant believes that every week a current event captures the imagination and attention of the nation, if not the world. Such events represent the signal, not the noise, of what is happening around us. This could be a shameful scandal, a terrible disaster, a marvelous development, an unexpected surprise, a huge disappointment, a political faux pas or a huge triumph. Whereas print and TV media, Internet and social networking sites, and all manners of blogs cover the entire news universe on a real time basis, BestBant occupies the other extreme, the Slow News Movement. “Opinions are formed by understanding powerful and reasoned arguments of opposing points of view,” says Dr. Law. These powerful arguments are made by individuals with specific information and unique expression. And these arguments can take the form of text (prose, poetic, rap, slam, parody or irony), images (pictures) and video (voice or performance). BestBant pits these arguments against each other and through user interaction the best voices rise to the top of our electronic bulletin board for all to read and enjoy.</p>
