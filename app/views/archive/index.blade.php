				<p>For the BestBant posting each week there will be a winner based on readership and 'up votes.'  These winners are called BestBant Scholars who have captured the most powerful voice on the weekly posting. The name, profile of winners and their winning content will be preserved in our Archive for future reference and recognition. These BestBant Scholars will also receive a digital certificate (badge) for their winning work. Therefore the BestBant Archive will be a library of the best opinion makers across the country.</p>
